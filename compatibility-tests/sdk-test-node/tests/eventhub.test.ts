/**
 * Event Hubs AMQP 1.0 compatibility tests against the Artemis sidecar.
 *
 * Uses rhea-promise (pure JS AMQP 1.0) to validate send/receive and multicast
 * delivery semantics. Each receiver connects to the event hub address and
 * Artemis assigns it an independent subscription queue — this mirrors the
 * consumer-group isolation model used by the Python/uamqp tests.
